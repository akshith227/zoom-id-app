# The Zoom ID app
### This app looks at the time and day and logs into the correct zoom meeting itself, with **no human input required**.

One time process of inputting the timetable to the app can be done through the index.html, and will download a file to your system.
### Copy the downloaded file to the same directory as the exe file, and you're done!
